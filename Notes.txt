STRUCTURE OF A COMMAND: (command_internals.h)

enum command_type
  {
    AND_COMMAND,         // A && B
    SEQUENCE_COMMAND,    // A ; B
    OR_COMMAND,          // A || B
    PIPE_COMMAND,        // A | B
    SIMPLE_COMMAND,      // a simple command
    SUBSHELL_COMMAND,    // ( A )
  };

// Data associated with a command.
struct command
{
  enum command_type type;

  // Exit status, or -1 if not known (e.g., because it has not exited yet).
  int status;

  // I/O redirections, or null if none.
  char *input;
  char *output;

  union
  {
    // for AND_COMMAND, SEQUENCE_COMMAND, OR_COMMAND, PIPE_COMMAND:
    struct command *command[2];

    // for SIMPLE_COMMAND:
    char **word;

    // for SUBSHELL_COMMAND:
    struct command *subshell_command;
  } u;
};

EXECUTING THE COMMANDS:

- Implement how to execute a simple command
- Other commands can use the simple command execution to execute their commands
- execvp(const char* file, char* const arv)
	~ file is probably going to be word[0], and arguments in word. For example:
		char* arg[] = {"ls", "-l", "/etc/resolvconf", 0}    --> will always end with 0.
		execvp(arg[0], arg);
