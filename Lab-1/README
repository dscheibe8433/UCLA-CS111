Replace this README file with notes on your implementation.
Mentions any special features or limitations.

There is a debugging system where we can set DEBUG to be one, to print out
the statements and observe what is happening. 

We freed most of the memory, but there may be memory leaks what we missed. 

We also used a doubly linked list which is slower than an array, but is easier
to implement for dynamic sizes.

All tests pass with no temp folder being created for the test.out, test.err, and test.sh
files so we know that we passed.
